            <div>
                <p>I've been a software engineer as early as my freshman year of high school. Going to a regional vocational technical high school has allowed me to start developing my skills early, meaning that I have experience in programming going back as early as 2018, giving me up to 7 years worth of programming experience. Although my primary experience is in Java, I've developed skills in other areas over the years, such as other programming languages like C and Python, web frameworks including React.js and AngularJS, and other potent development technologies. I'm passionate about software development and software engineering, and I hope to secure an occupation in the field.</p>
